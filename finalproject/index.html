                <p>
                    In 2017, I joined the newspaper course at my high school, having taken a journalism class the year prior.  
                    The latter taught the ethics and basics necessary for writing any story, and provided many opportunities to write pieces to be published in the newspaper. 
                    Transitioning onto the newspaper team, my intention was to write a mix of content, starting with student profiles. This was to slowly ease into more informative pieces, like news stories. 
                    Though I had worked on three large feature stories, there was a change in direction right before mid-terms. 
                    New music and video games were slowly trickling out in this time period, and it was impossible to ignore the chance of adding thoughts about these. 
                    However, all of the work for news stories was leading into a competing style of writing, being purely objective and straight-forward. 
                    If I were to write reviews, it would be an alien concept to say the least, since these works can afford to be subjective and thematic. 
                    These contrasting principles lead to a single question, one that I hadn't discovered an answer for: how should a review be written?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was essentially uncharted territory for my writing in November 2017, when I obtained a review slot for the newspaper's print edition to write on the then-new "Call of Duty: WWII". 
                    The guidelines given were slim: a word limit of 350 words, avoiding an overuse of first-person pronouns, invoking comparisons to similar works, and essential formatting. 
                    For such a gigantic game, how could all of the relevant content be packed into such a short word count? 
                    Somehow, the dozens of hours that the game can provide had to be restricted to a quantity equivalent to the essays typical of those found in my middle school writings. 
                    My early solution was to divide up the count into five sections: the usual 100 word hook (or introduction), 75 words per each game mode, and an impressively brief conclusion. 
                    The numerous maps, items, bits of UI, and other aspects of multiplayer had to be heavily compressed, with little room for any critical analysis. 
                    Any criticism was not fleshed out, and at most a sentence long. By the time of publishing, the conclusion was absent. 
                    What amounted from this was little more than a summary of the content.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After the piece was released in early November, there was then a two month long hiatus from writing reviews, switching back to news stories in the mean time. 
                    When January 2018 arrived, "Fortnite" was closer to its apex in popularity. 
                    Conversation about it was stirring, and friends encouraged me to give it a try. 
                    I decided to take advantage of the clamour, picking up a review slot for it. 
                    Five hours into it, there was enough notes on it to supplement a whole review. 
                    The result was a dramatic improvement from the last review. Reading it back again, there is a tighter focus on relevant information, namely the price point and atmosphere. 
                    The criticism is also easily noticeable, with remarks about its features being "laborious" or "infuriating", among other information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, it was brought to my attention that there was the option of web reviews. 
                    These were without a word count limit, and didn't require the content to be less than a month old - or so I thought, anyways. 
                    Unfortunately, what was written managed to be convuluted and dull, and akin to a summary due to my reluctance to criticize. 
                    The time spent playing the games diminished, content was rushed out with few revisions, and progress reversed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uncomfortable with the lack of developments, I retraced my steps to the original question: how should a review be written? 
                    It was evident that the reviews were suffering by an assortment of factors. 
                    To reiterate: they read like summaries, and due to this, were plain and uninteresting. 
                    For the most part, rebuking game mechanics was minimal, causing games of poor quality to appear more glamorous than they should have. 
                    Analysis was weak, leaving the review shallow. Tiny game features had equal weight to vital ones, stripping away valuable words. 
                    All of these thoughts were used to formulate the "Luftrausers" review in May 2018. 
                    To allay boredom, improved rhetoric was added by way of imagery and vivid language.

                        A quote from my review of "Luftrausers".  
                        Quote published in the online edition of North Pointe in May 2018.

                    In the review, there was also a central subject: how the flight mechanics influenced gameplay. 
                    These features were the salient topic for the game, and any other feature was disregarded in the mean time. 
                    For a review made of a thousand words, the extreme focus wouldn't be optimal.
                    But for a light amount of 350 words, it was perfect. 
                    Every detail of the mechanics transitioned well to one another from the powerful images described. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every review thereafter was written with the same objectives in mind, but to varying success. 
                    A new conflict started: if every review was made with the same methods of "Luftrausers", no progress could be made in diversity and interest for the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the 2017-2018 school year, my time writing for the newspaper was complete. 
                    Ever since then, each attempt at writing a review has only resulted in pages upon pages of notes - no actual content has been released. 
                    I have now realized that I was asking the right question, but out of order. 
                    Impactful starter questions would be: why should I write this review? What stands out about this game? How does this relate to the interests of others playing games? 
                    Responses to these questions can give valid answers to who the audience may be, how the writing can be geared towards these players, and if the review has worth. 
                    With these, the original question can be answered more succinctly. 
                    Another question that could guide this process along better is if there is a way to use other media to complement the review. 
                    For instance, using a gallery:
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <picture>
                        <img id = "gallery" src= 'media/dirtrally.jpg'  alt = "Images of 'DiRT Rally'.">
                    </picture>
                    <picture>
                        <img id = "gallery" src= 'media/civvi.jpg'  alt = "Image of 'Sid Meier's Civilization VI'.">
                    </picture>
                    <figcaption>
                        Respectively, these images are from: "DiRT Rally" and "Sid Meier's Civilization VI".
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                    These can provide a different outlook of the game than those selected by the developer or their marketing team, or random frames from trailers or playthrough videos. 
                    They allow the reader to better imagine how mechanics or visuals operate in the game. 
                    In my time at North Pointe, images were only used for thumbnails. 
                    However, putting these throughout the article can also break up particularly lengthy monologues of text. 
                    The same can be said for quotes from articles and sources, or for the inclusion of videos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These new perspectives on structuring a review should be gamechanging for the ones I make in the future. 
                    Hopefully, these ideas give insight into why the old reviews had changed greatly over only a year, and portray the shift from old work to new work in a better light.
